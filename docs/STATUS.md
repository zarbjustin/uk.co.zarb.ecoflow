# Project Status & Handoff — EcoFlow STREAM Series

> Living status doc. Read this first when resuming work on `uk.co.zarb.ecoflow`.

## Outstanding / next actions (resume here)

- [ ] **STREAM AC 5000 live gate** — install the next Test build and complete the
  charging/discharging/idle plus 24–48-hour soak matrix in
  `docs/STREAM_AC5000_SPRINTS.md`. Code-side Sprint 1–4 work is complete.
- [ ] **Hardware verification** — run the HomeyScript probe in `docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION.md`:
  confirm the self-heating field, STREAM Max (BK41) 2-PV count, and per-socket fields; then adjust
  `lib/streamModels.ts` / `lib/streamMapping.ts` if needed.

## Current development state (2026-08-10)

- Source version: **v1.10.7**; this working change has not been versioned or
  published yet.
- New pairing entry: `stream_5000_unit` (**STREAM 5000 Series Unit**).
- Current verified product: STREAM AC 5000 with serial prefix `ES22`, using the
  dedicated `es22` monitoring adapter.
- Legacy `stream_ac5000` is deprecated but remains operational for existing
  Homey devices; both drivers share one lifecycle and credential scope.
- STREAM 5000, STREAM Expansion Battery 5000 and STREAM Gateway remain hidden
  until a serial prefix and product-specific telemetry adapter are verified.
- Future-product policy and admission checklist:
  `docs/STREAM_5000_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Suggested next-release changelog (family-driver architecture)

> Adds the future-ready STREAM 5000 Series Unit pairing entry, with verified
> STREAM AC 5000 monitoring today. Existing AC 5000 devices keep working through
> the deprecated compatibility entry. New 5000-series hardware is only exposed
> after its serial prefix and telemetry protocol have been verified.

## Suggested next-release changelog (for the version workflow)

> STREAM AC 5000 now reports battery percentage on firmware V1.1.4.35 and is
> recognised as a home battery by Homey Energy. Diagnostics now provide safe,
> time-aligned telemetry snapshots and clearer connection/parser health while
> preserving the verified battery, house and grid power calculations.

## Release state (2026-07-26)

- **Latest version:** **v1.10.3** — **Build ID 18** is **live in the Homey App Store**.
- v1.10.3 replaces all five light/dark widget preview pairs with deterministic, text-free,
  transparent 1024x1024 artwork that follows Homey's Widget Preview guidelines.
- The release is tagged as `v1.10.3`; the public Homey Apps API reports `liveVersion: 1.10.3`,
  `liveBuild.id: 18`, and `liveBuild.state: live`.
- v1.10.1 was the previously certified feature release containing the multi-model review,
  fit-and-finish sprints, enriched App Store tags, and `bugs` URL. PayPal donate = `zarbie`.

## Fit-and-finish sprints (2026-07-20, after v1.9.0 / Build 14)

Merged to `master` via PRs #2–#5 (each build/lint/test/validate green):
- **S1 hardening:** REST retry (`lib/retry.ts`), `batteryEnergyMode` latch tests, widget in-flight
  guard + pagehide teardown.
- **S2 i18n:** German + Dutch across the whole app (279 localized objects).
- **S3 solar forecast:** real Open-Meteo forecast (`lib/solarForecast.ts`), `solar_forecast_today/
  tomorrow` capabilities, geolocation permission, forecast widget + conditions.
- **S4 tariff (provider-agnostic):** `Set current electricity price` action + `Electricity price`
  capability + price/negative-price conditions (shared `lib/thresholds.ts`); works with any tariff
  app (Octopus/Tibber/aWATTar/…) in any region; Energy Recommendation widget shows the price.
- **S5/S6 polish + hardware tooling:** README/docs refresh, provider-agnostic `OCTOPUS_FLOWS.md`,
  `docs/HARDWARE_VERIFICATION.md` + the HomeyScript probe.
- **Status:** 68/68 tests pass; lint clean; validates at `--level publish`.

## Suggested v1.10.0 changelog (for the version workflow)
> German & Dutch translations. New: real solar forecast (today & tomorrow) from your local weather,
> and tariff-aware Flows that work with any electricity-price app. Plus sturdier connectivity and
> more reliable widgets.

## Previously — review & hardening pass on v1.8.6 (2026-07-20)
- [ ] Optional: verify the 8524-safe reserve sequence, `Release battery for export now`, and the
  new grid threshold triggers on the live STREAM.

## Review & hardening pass on v1.8.6 (2026-07-20)

A full multi-model review + implementation pass on the current release (branch
`copilot/review-v1.8.6`, PR pending):
- **Deliverables:** `docs/PRODUCT_RESEARCH.md`, `docs/CODE_REVIEW_v1.8.6.md` (GPT-5.6 Sol +
  GPT-5.5 + Opus 4.8), `docs/FEATURE_EVALUATION.md`, `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/SPRINTS.md`,
  `docs/PRE_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`.
- **Widgets (Sprint 1, certification fix):** replaced the shared placeholder with a **distinct,
  simplified, text-free preview pair per widget** (`npm run widgets:preview`), exported on
  transparent 1024x1024 canvases; fixed the reversed Energy-Flow grid arrow; renamed "Solar
  Forecast" → "Solar Target" and "Tariff Opportunity" → "Energy
  Recommendation"; qualified the estimated consumption/independence values; mute on no-device.
- **High fixes (Sprint 2):** H1 backup-reserve 8524 ordering + verify (+ `Release battery for
  export now`); H2 `onUninit` flushes `EnergyCheckpoint` so meters stay monotonic across restarts;
  H3 counter-latch stops battery double-count; H4 MQTT session can't survive teardown.
- **Medium/low (Sprint 3):** BK41 PV count 4→2; history midnight reset + blank-parse; MQTT
  reconnect credential refresh; timer/reference cleanups.
- **Features (Sprint 4):** solar-below, charging-from-solar, grid import/export threshold triggers.
- **Status:** 51/51 tests pass; lint clean; `homey app validate --level publish` clean.
- **Already-fixed on master (not redone):** trigger state machine (`flowStates`), empty-string
  parsing, poll/MQTT serialization, `getId()` binding, signing/SSRF security, 3–100% reserve.

## Suggested v1.9.0 changelog (for the version workflow)
> Five dashboard widgets now each have their own Homey-compliant preview; safer backup-reserve control
> (fixes a silent no-op); trustworthy energy meters across restarts; sturdier realtime connection;
> new tariff/grid Flow cards; STREAM Max solar-input fix.

## Session log

- **2026-07-26** — Rebuilt all ten widget preview assets as distinct, deterministic SVG-derived
  illustrations with transparent canvases and no text or screenshots. Added preview compliance
  tests, updated reviewer documentation, released **v1.10.3**, and published **Build 18** live in
  the Homey App Store.
- **2026-06-25** — Cloned repo; renamed app **"EcoFlow - Stream Systems" → "EcoFlow STREAM Series"**;
  set app icon to white EF monogram on black (`brandColor #000000`). Drafted the standalone-app
  certification reply + refreshed reviewer notes. Implemented recommendation sets **A/B/C**
  (see below) and shipped **v1.8.0 / Build 7**, installed on the local Homey Pro. Releases this
  session: v1.7.9 (black icon) → v1.7.10 (rename) → v1.8.0 (A/B/C features).

## Historical snapshot — v1.8.6 (2026-07-17)

- **App:** `uk.co.zarb.ecoflow` — "EcoFlow STREAM Series" · SDK v3 · TypeScript.
- **Latest version:** **v1.8.6** (tag `v1.8.6`).
- **Release note:** Backup reserve controls now support the full 3-100% STREAM range,
  and App Store search tags improve discoverability.
- **Local install:** v1.8.6 installed on **Justin's Homey Pro** (192.168.1.142) via
  `homey app install`.
- **Branding:** app icon is the **white EcoFlow EF monogram on a black background**
  (`brandColor: #000000`, `assets/icon.svg` monogram fill white). Black `brandColor`
  also tints the app's accent colour elsewhere in the Homey UI — this is intentional.

## Recent feature additions (v1.8.0)

Grounded in the EcoFlow STREAM product line + the app's own backlog:
- **A1** Corrected MPPT/solar-input counts from official specs (Ultra=4, Pro=3, Ultra X=4)
  in `lib/streamModels.ts`; per-unit PV tiles follow automatically.
- **A2** Daily-history tiles (`energy_*_today`, `co2_today`, `energy_independence`) are now
  **added on demand** only when EcoFlow's history feed returns data, and blank ones are
  cleaned up on upgrade — no empty energy tiles for models whose history API is rejected.
- **A3** Removed dead PowerStream-only capabilities (`output_target_power`, `supply_priority`,
  `ps_charge_limit`, `ps_discharge_limit`, `led_brightness`) from the shipped surface.
- **B5** New tariff Flow actions: **Prepare for cheap grid import** and **Prepare for peak / export**.
- **B6** New condition: **Battery level is above/below**.
- **C7** New read-only **AC output** info setting (notes the 2300 W paired figure for Ultra/Ultra X).
- **C8** New **Self-heating** read-only tile, added on demand when the unit reports a heating field
  (candidate field names pending hardware confirmation — see `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`).
- **B4** Added `docs/OCTOPUS_FLOWS.md` — ready-made Octopus Agile automation recipes.

## Scope (deliberate)

- Focused **only** on the EcoFlow **STREAM** balcony-solar/battery product line and the
  EcoFlow **Smart Meter**.
- PowerStream and portable power stations are **intentionally excluded** — PowerStream
  lives in `disabled-drivers/powerstream/` and is not shipped.
- Shipped drivers: `stream`, `stream_unit`, `stream_solar`, `stream_micro`,
  `stream_socket`, `smartmeter`, `stream_5000_unit`, plus deprecated
  compatibility driver `stream_ac5000`.

## Homey Energy integration (the differentiator)

- `stream` → `energy.homeBattery: true` + `meter_power.charged/.discharged` (home storage).
- `stream_unit` → `energy.batteries: ['INTERNAL']`.
- `smartmeter` → `energy.cumulative` + `meter_power.imported/.exported` (grid meter).
- `stream_solar` / `stream_micro` → `meterPowerExportedCapability` (solar production).
- Energy-decision Flow cards: `set_operating_mode`, `set_backup_reserve`,
  `set_charge_limit`, `set_discharge_limit`, `set_feed_in`; plus grid/solar triggers and
  conditions. Core use case: drive STREAM charge/discharge from **Octopus Agile** prices
  via Homey Flow.

## App Store certification — resolved

The Homey reviewer flagged device overlap with **Marcus Valk's** app
**"EcoFlow - Portable power stations"** (`com.ecoflow.ecoflowpro`,
<https://homey.app/a/com.ecoflow.ecoflowpro>), which already lists the STREAM models
(AC Pro/Pro/AC/Max/Ultra/Ultra X) plus PowerStream, Smart Plug, Smart Home Panel and the
Delta portable stations. The reviewer asked us to merge/PR into that app or justify a
standalone app.

- **Our position:** standalone app justified by **focus** (STREAM-only) + **Energy-native
  design** + **Octopus tariff automation** — not device exclusivity (the overlap is real).
- **Drafted reply + evidence table:** [`docs/CERTIFICATION_REPLY.md`](./CERTIFICATION_REPLY.md).
- **Reviewer test notes:** [`docs/REVIEWER_NOTES.md`](./REVIEWER_NOTES.md).
- **Outcome:** the standalone STREAM-focused app was approved. The widget-preview correction
  shipped in **v1.10.3 / Build 18**, which is live in the Homey App Store.
- Keep the reply and reviewer notes as evidence for future certification questions. If device
  overlap is raised again, continue to ground the response in focus, Energy-native integration,
  and tariff automation rather than device exclusivity.

## Release process (verified this session)

1. Commit & push changes to `master`.
2. **Version bump:** GitHub Actions → run *Update Homey App Version* workflow
   (`homey-app-version.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`) with `version=patch|minor|major` +
   `changelog`. It bumps `app.json`/`.homeycompose`, updates `.homeychangelog.json`,
   commits, tags `vX.Y.Z` and creates a release.
   - CLI: `gh workflow run homey-app-version.yml -f version=patch -f changelog="..."`
3. **Publish to App Store:** run *Publish Homey App* workflow (`homey-app-publish.yml`,
   `workflow_dispatch`). Uses `HOMEY_PAT`; creates a new Build ID and uploads.
   - CLI: `gh workflow run homey-app-publish.yml`
4. **Local install (optional):** `npx homey app install` (installs on the selected Homey
   Pro; requires `homey login` + `homey select`).
5. `git pull` to sync the version-bump commit/tag the workflow pushed.

> Do not hand-edit the version — let the version workflow own it. Edit `brandColor`,
> icons, etc. in **`.homeycompose/app.json`** (source of truth); `homey app build`
> regenerates `app.json`.
